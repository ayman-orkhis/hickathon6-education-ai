#  Curriculum Compass — Team 11  
##  1. Problem Overview

Many students finish compulsory schooling without mastering key mathematical concepts.  
Misunderstandings accumulate unnoticed, teachers only see local difficulties, and ministries rely on aggregate exam results that hide conceptual issues.

Additional challenges include:

- Unequal access to academic support  
- Lack of curriculum-aligned AI tools  
- Employers relying on credentials instead of observable skills

##  2. Dataset Description

We used a unified dataset combining the **2015, 2018, and 2022 PISA cycles**, containing:

- **~1.7 million student samples**  
- **250+ engineered numerical features**  
- Variables grouped into themes such as:  
  - Learning habits  
  - Family & socioeconomic background  
  - School climate  
  - Item-level behaviour (scores & response times)

###  Task 1 — Regression  
Predict each student's **MathScore** using survey-based and behavioural features.

###  Task 2 — Innovation  
Design an AI-powered educational solution leveraging insights from the dataset.

##  3. Our Modeling Approach

### 3.1  Preprocessing

We built a robust data cleaning pipeline:

- Removed features with **>80% missing values**  
- Prevented **data leakage** by excluding variables containing target-related averaged scores  
- Consolidated redundant features to reduce dimensionality and improve interpretability

### 3.2  Model Selection

We tested multiple gradient boosting models optimized for tabular data:

- **XGBoost** → Best performing model  
- **LightGBM** → Very fast training  
- **CatBoost** → Strong categorical handling  
- **Hybrid ensemble** (experimental) combining all three

### 3.3  Hyperparameter Tuning

We used two optimization strategies:

- **GridSearchCV** for exhaustive search  
- **Optuna** for Bayesian optimization  

These techniques improved model performance, stability, and generalization.

##  4. Insights & Results

Our final model identified several important predictors of mathematical performance:

- Student engagement  
- School environment  
- Family background  
- Cognitive behaviours (response times, attempt patterns)

Future improvements include:

- Feature scaling  
- Advanced imputation  
- Interaction feature creation

##  5. Innovation: Curriculum Compass

Beyond prediction, we developed a complete AI platform concept:

###  Student Companion  
A curriculum-aligned AI tutor that provides:

- Reliable explanations  
- Adaptive difficulty  
- Consistent alignment with national standards  

###  Curriculum Insights Dashboard  
Aggregates anonymised student questions into:

- Misunderstanding heatmaps  
- Topic difficulty trends  
- Class/school/country-level analytics
